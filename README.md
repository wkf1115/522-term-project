We provide a method for invariant inference of C programs using inputs generated by AFL mutations.

## Installation

We use the java language to complete the programming. And we provide a java jar to run the program.


``` 
java -cp auto_daikon-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:$DAIKONDIR/daikon.jar auto.Main
```
$DAIKONDIR is the path of daikon software, for example /home/daikonparent/daikon-5.8.16



## Config

Please put the configuration file config.yml in the same directory of the jar package. The configuration in the configuration file contains the following:

```agsl
projectPath: /home/dock/wkf/program/
projectName : fra-update
daikonInstrumentFile : fra-update-daikon
```

In this example the program fra-update.c should be placed in the /home/dock/wkf/program/fra-update directory. daikonInstrumentFile is the file after binary instrumentation using daikon, it will be automatically generated in the projectPath/projectName/ folder.

## Result

Our results (interesting inputs) will be generated in the res folder in the same directory as the jar package. Each of the txt files represents an input and contains invariants of two different programs, representing why this input is interesting (which inavriants it can change the program).
